As part of the Advanced Modeling Course in the Applied Mechanical Design Program at Fanshawe College, a comprehensive teardown of a vacuum cleaner was conducted. After calibrating the tools, precise measurements were taken to produce a reverse-engineered CAD model. A detailed teardown report was completed to document the process of recreating the vacuum cleaner through reverse engineering.
